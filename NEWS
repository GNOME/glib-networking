2.38.0
======
  * New stable release. (No changes since 2.37.5)

2.37.5
======
  * gnutls: minimum version is now 2.12.8 (with 3.x preferred...)

  * glib-networking now supports the --enable-installed-tests flag, to
    install its test programs to run at other times (ie, after
    updating glib)

2.37.4
======
  * proxy/gnome: further improve GNOME session detection (#701377)

  * gnutls: don't crash if $G_TLS_GNUTS_PRIORITY is invalid (#701693)

2.37.2
======
  * proxy/gnome: Improve session-type detection to include
    gnome-classic and anything else starting with "gnome" (#700607,
    Giovanni Campagna)

  * proxy/libproxy: make SOCKS work when using the async API (#699359,
    Dan)

  * proxy/tests: make the libproxy test program use the just-built
    plugin rather than the installed one. Oops (#700286, Iain Lane)

  * proxy/tests: fix to not error out if neither proxy module is built
    (#700628, Dan)

  * tls/tests: fix a sporadic crash (Dan)

2.37.1
======
  * gnutls: Fixed a bug that could cause hangs and/or bursts of CPU
    usage in some cases. (#696881, Olivier Crête)

  * gnutls: Fixed CFLAGS when building with gnutls in a different
    prefix. (#696519, Emmanuel Pacaud)

  * gnutls: Fixed a hang while rehandshaking with gnutls 3.x (#695062,
    Dan)

  * gnutls: Fixed a handshaking crash in multithreaded use (#697754,
    Olivier Crête)

  * proxy/gnome: Fix "automatic" mode, which was mistakenly being
    treated as "none" (Dan)

  * proxy/gnome: Use this in Unity sessions as well as GNOME ones.
    (#698936, Iain Lane)

  * New/Updated translations:
	Friulian, Indonesian, Turkish

2.36.0
=======
  * New/Updated translations:
	Assamese, Basque, Belarusian, Catalan (Valencian), Catalan,
	Danish, Finnish, Hindi, Korean, Latvian, Persian, Portuguese,
	Russian, Slovak, Tadjik, Thai

2.35.9
======
  * Fixed one kind of handshake failure to return the correct error
    code under gnutls 3.x (allowing libsoup to recognize the error and
    do fallback to SSL 3.0). (#694812)

  * Updated translations:
	Chinese (traditional), French, German, Punjabi, Uyghur,
	Vietnamese

2.35.8
======
  * proxy/gnome: ported to new GSimpleProxyResolver, and added more
    tests

  * gnutls: Fixed a small per-connection leak (#693718)

  * tls/tests: Fixed several race conditions that caused spurious
    failures. (#693720)

  * Updated translations:
	Malayalam

2.35.6
======
  * proxy/gnome: Fixed several bugs:

	* Multithreaded usage could result in crashes

	* In "automatic" mode, synchronous lookups would obey
	  ignore-hosts, but asynchronous lookups would not. (Now they
	  both do.)

	* lookup_async() would never notice if the proxy settings
	  switched from "automatic" to "manual" or "none" (and would
	  make a synchronous D-Bus call when switching in the other
	  direction).

	* If given an invalid URI, lookup_async() would return a
	  successful result (and leak the GError that it was supposed
	  to have returned), and lookup() would return both the error
	  and the proxy (leaking one or the other, depending on how
	  the caller behaved).

  * Updated translations:
	Italian, Malayalam, Norwegian bokmål, Serbian, Uyghur

2.35.4
======
  * proxy/gnome: The tests should now work correctly even if
    run from a non-GNOME environment. (Robert Ancell)

  * Updated translations:
	Brazilian Portuguese, Bulgarian, Estonian, Galician, Greek,
	Hungarian, Slovenian

2.35.3
======
  * build: The TLS tests are now not built if you are building without
    gnutls support. (Saleem Abdulrasool)

  * gnutls: Several handshaking fixes:

	* Fix a hang when doing a synchronous close() immediately
          after cancelling an asynchronous handshake() (which would
          happen in libsoup if you cancelled a message at the right
          time). (#688751, Dan)

	* Avoid an assertion when an implicit handshake fails
	  (#689274, Stef)

	* Fixed GTlsServerConnection:authentication-mode to work
          again, and added a regression test for this. (#689259, Stef)

	* Return the appropriate error
          (G_TLS_ERROR_CERTIFICATE_REQUIRED) when a handshake fails
          because the server required a certificate but none was
          provided, and added a test for this. (#689260, Stef)

	* Make g_io_stream_close() finish successfully after a failed
          handshake (#689260, Stef)

	* Make g_io_stream_close() finish successfully before a
	  handshake (#689271, Stef)

  * gnutls: Updated to be aware of G_IO_ERROR_BROKEN_PIPE in glib
    2.35.3, which needs to be converted to G_TLS_ERROR_NOT_TLS in some
    cases. (Previously this error showed up as just G_IO_ERROR_FAILED.)
    (Dan)

  * proxy/gnome: This is now only used in GNOME login sessions (as,
    essentially, a more efficient version of the libproxy GNOME
    backend); in non-GNOME sessions, gio will now fall back to the
    libproxy plugin, allowing environment variables or other libproxy
    settings backends to be used.

  * New/Updated translations:
	Czech, Hebrew, Lithuanian, Polish, Slovak, Spanish

2.35.1
======
  * Update for glib 2.35.1; remove g_type_init() calls and port to
    GTask.

  * Updated translations:
	Estonian

2.34.0
======
  * Updated translations:
	Arabic, Bulgarian, Catalan (Valencian), Catalan, Chinese
	(Simplified), Hindi, Japanese, Thai

=======
  * Updated translations:
	Brazilian Portuguese, British English, Czech, Danish, Finnish,
	French, German, Korean, Punjabi

2.33.12
=======
  * gnutls: Revert the addition of the certificate-bytes and
    private-key-bytes properties to GTlsCertificateGnutls, since they
    were reverted in glib. (#682081, Stef)

  * Updated translations:
	Belarusian, Hungarian, Indonesian, Italian, Latvian, Polish,
	Polish, Vietnamese

2.33.10
=======
  * gnutls: Improved the certificate verifying code to deal with the
    case of a CA being reissued with the same key but a different
    signature algorithm. (#681299, Stef)

  * gnutls: Fixed an uninitialized variable in
    g_tls_connection_gnutls_close(). (#681636)

  * Updated translations:
	Assamese, Portuguese, Telugu

2.33.8
======
  * gnutls: If a GTlsConnection gets an error when handshaking, it
    will now continue to return that error message on future I/O
    attempts, rather than behaving in an undefined manner.

  * gnutls: You can now read from a GTlsConnection's input stream and
    write to its output stream at the same time (either in different
    threads, or asynchronously in a single thread). (#660252)

  * Updated translations:
	Chinese (traditional), Galician, Greek, Hebrew, Lithuanian,
	Norwegian bokmål, Russian, Serbian, Slovenian, Spanish

2.33.3
======
  * Updated autogen.sh (in particular to support automake 1.12)
    (#675261)

  * gnutls: fix the use-system-certdb property on GTlsConnectionGnutls
    (previously, setting it to FALSE was a no-op).

  * Updated translations:
	Dutch, Greek, Indonesian

2.33.2
======
  * gnutls: simplify using new glib pollable stream methods

  * proxy/gnome: fix a bug that made it impossible to use SOCKS
    without also having a separate http proxy.

2.32.1
======
  * gnutls: added /etc/ssl/ca-bundle.pem to the list of files to check
    for to use as the default CA list. (This is what openSUSE uses.)
    (#673944, Federico Mena Quintero)

  * Updated translations:
	Catalan (Valencian), Marathi, Odia, Persian

2.32.0
======

  * Updated translations:
	Assamese, Basque, Belarusian, Brazilian Portuguese, Danish,
	Estonian, French, German, Hungarian, Italian, Korean, Polish,
	Russian, Serbian

2.31.16
=======
  * gnutls: Fixed a TLS handshaking bug that in particular caused lots
    of crashes in epiphany. (#658771)

  * tls/tests: Fixed a bug in the pkcs11-pin test that could cause it
    to spuriously fail

  * Updated translations:
	Bulgarian, Chinese (traditional), Czech, Japanese,
	Norwegian bokmål, Turkish, Vietnamese

2.31.6
======
  * gnutls
	* Support gnutls built against nettle instead of gcrypt
          (#657306)

	* Implement TLS session caching for GTlsServerConnection
          (#636574)

    avoid warnings in partial jhbuild environments

  * proxy/gnome: Update to use GInetAddressMask

  * Updated translations:
	Chinese (simplified), Hebrew, Norwegian bokmål, Slovenian,
	Swedish, Ukranian

2.31.2
======
  * gnutls
	* Added gnutls-pkcs11 backend, which uses gnutls 2.12.8 and
	  p11-kit (a new optional dependency) to provide access to
	  PKCS#11 tokens. At the moment, this is only enabled if you
	  set GIO_USE_TLS=gnutls-pkcs11 in the environment. (Stef,
	  #656361)

	* GTlsCertificateGnutls can now read unencrypted PKCS#8 keys
	  (which show "BEGIN PRIVATE KEY" in PEM form) in addition to
	  the previously-supported PKCS#1 keys ("BEGIN RSA PRIVATE
	  KEY").

  * Updated translations:
	Galician, German, Lithuanian, Norwegian bokmål, Spanish,
	Turkish

2.31.0
======
  * gnutls
	* Bumped required GNUTLS version to 2.11.0 and updated
	  code for that (Stef, #656903)

	* Fixed a crash when passing a NULL GCancellable to
	  g_tls_connection_close_async() (Dan, #659786) or a NULL
	  GError to g_tls_file_database_new().

	* Fixed handling of self-signed CA certificates in
	  GTlsDatabaseGnutls (Dan, #660508)

	* Added another G_TLS_ERROR_NOT_TLS (aka "dumb server, try
	  falling back from TLS to SSLv3") case, when the handshake
	  completes but then packets after that don't decrypt
	  correctly. (Dan, #662104)

	* Made sure that GTlsConnection:peer-certificate and
          :peer-certificate-errors get set even when the peer
          certificate is rejected. (Dan)

  * proxy/gnome
	* Fixed ignore_hosts handling (Dan, #655581)

	* Fixed configure check so that "--without-gnome-proxy" works.
	  (Alexandre Rostovtsev, #662203)

	* Fixed tests to only build the gnome proxy test if we're
	  building the gnome proxy. (Kalev Lember, #662085)

  * New translations:
	Telugu

2.30.0
======
  * Updated translation:
	Thai

2.29.92
=======
  * New/updated translations:
	Belarusian, Tamil, Japanese

  * gnutls: Fixed a problem when linking against GNUTLS 3.0, where
    connections would sometimes return the error "The TLS connection
    was non-properly terminated". (Dan Winship, #659233)

  * gnutls: Plugged a few memory leaks (Dan Winship)

2.29.18
=======
  * gnutls: fixed two rehandshaking bugs; one in which a client
    would erroneously report an error after successfully rehandshaking
    (Igor Makarov, #653645), and one where initiating an asynchronous
    rehandshake on the server side would send illegal packets and
    cause the client to disconnect (Dan Winship).

  * gnutls: made GTlsDatabaseGnutls and GTlsFileDatabaseGnutls
    properly cancellable (Stef Walter)

  * gnutls: fixed the client-side session cache to not share session
    IDs between different virtual hosts on the same IP address, which
    caused problems with some servers. (Dan Winship, #581342)

  * tls: Fixed up the tls test program so it can be run from "make
    check" (Stef Walter)

  * New translations:
	Persian

2.29.15
=======
  * gnutls: implement GTlsDatabase (Stef Walter, #636572)

  * gnutls: override minimum key length, to allow connecting to HTTP
    servers with very small keys (eg, on some embedded devices). (Dan
    Winship, #652284).

  * gnutls: use %COMPAT mode, which makes GNUTLS behave more like
    OpenSSL/NSS/Windows in a few ways, making it work with certain
    broken HTTP servers. (Dan Winship, part of #581342)

  * gnutls: fixed a crash when passed a NULL GError (Dan Winship)

2.29.9
======
  * Optimized GDBus usage in PACRunner (davidz)

  * Fixed a race condition in GProxyResolverGnome (davidz)

  * Changed configure to --enable-maintainer-mode by default,

======
  * New/updated translations:
	Basque, Brazilian Portuguese, Chinese (Traditional), Danish,
	Hindi, Kannada, Marathi, Uyghur

2.28.4
======
  * Added a new proxy backend, GProxyResolverGnome, that uses
    GSettings and the network proxy schemas from
    gsettings-desktop-schemas to provide proxy information (and using
    a new D-Bus service provided by the libproxy backend to provide
    PAC/WPAD support).

    If you are building glib-networking in a GNOME 3.0 environment,
    you should make sure that gsettings-desktop-schemas.pc is
    available when building, so that this backend gets built.

  * New translations:
	Assamese, Latvian, Oriya, Serbian

2.28.0
======
  * Fixed broken libtool check in autogen.sh that failed for libtool
    2.4 (Dan Williams)

=======
  * Fixed configure script to actually error out if installed glib
    version is too old (Emilio Pozuelo Monfort)

  * gnutls: updated GTlsClientConnectionGnutls for :accepted-cas type
    change (Stef Walter)
  * gnutls: fixed an uninitialized variable (Dan Winship)

    but non-functional in 2.27.4
  * gnutls: updates for glib TLS API changes
  * gnutls: fix some async bugs that caused the main loop to spin
  * gnutls: implement a client-side session cache, to speed up
